phone with a count 168
1  [t]excellent phone , excellent service .
2  there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
3  my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
4  i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
5  [t]slightly better than average phone in its class .
6  my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
7  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
8  the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
9  their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
10  [t]good phone , so-so service .
11  i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
12  the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
13  here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
14  [t]cool phone !
15  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
16  the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
17  nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
18  [t]t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone .
19  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
20  the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
21  the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
22  overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
23  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
24  they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
25  this is the best phone i have seen .
26  [t]perfect phone .
27  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you won't scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidentally hitting the keys .
28  the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
29  [t]great phone , great service , no voice dialing .
30  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
31  other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
32  when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
33  the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
34  [t]best phone for free .
35  please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
36  two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
37  this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
38  i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didn't really need one .
39  this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beautiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
40  [t]great phone , but what did you say ?
41  i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
42  from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
43  for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
44  the phones are awesome .
45  overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
46  the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesn't weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
47  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
48  it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
49  i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
50  nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
51  [t]a good phone .
52  this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
53  i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
54  this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
55  ***[t]great phone , but no warranty !
56  the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
57  this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
58  it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
59  this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
60  [t]great speakerphone and great reception ! ! recommend !
61  the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
62  while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
63  nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
64  this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
65  although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
66  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
67  the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
68  [t]awesome phone choice .
69  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
70  the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
71  not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
72  this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
73  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
74  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
75  one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
76  no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
77  it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
78  the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
79  this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
80  great phone , i 'd buy another .
81  [t]excellent phone .
82  excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
83  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
84  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
85  great phone .. .
86  it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
87  i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
88  the battery life on this phone is surreal .
89  nice little phone ... light compact . .
90  i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
91  it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
92  that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
93  overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
94  speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
95  [t]awesome phone , great prices on amazon.com .
96  [t]best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) .
97  it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
98  the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
99  the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
100  1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
101  this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
102  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
103  great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
104  which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
105  overall an excellent phone .
106  the phone is very light weight .
107  do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
108  one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
109  i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
110  that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
111  this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
112  this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
113  [t]6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand .
114  and really this is the best phone one could have .
115  tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
116  [t]best of the best mobile phone .
117  while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
118  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
quality	 :4.25 Stars
quality with a count 17
1  the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
2  the radio feature has superb sound quality .
3  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
4  the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
5  the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
6  nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
7  the most important thing for me is sound quality .
8  the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
9  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
10  the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
11  - excellent sound quality
12  this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
13  with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .

1  radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
2  it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
3  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
4  it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
5  the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
6  sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
7  the features are really cool like the radio .
8  whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
9  the fm radio is cool .
battery	 :4.5454545 Stars
battery with a count 10
1  on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
2  battery life is good for a phone of this size .
3  it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
4  however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
5  the battery life is amazing .
6  great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
7  it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
8  the battery is a lot better than most of the phones out there .
9  battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
game	 :5.0 Stars
game with a count 9
1  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
2  it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
3  i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
4  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
5  there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
6  disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
7  nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
nokia	 :5.0 Stars
nokia with a count 8
1  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
2  ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
3  i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
4  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
5  [t]nokia 6610 great for games and ringtones .
6  the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
voice	 :3.181818 Stars
voice with a count 7
1  the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
2  i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
3  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
4  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
5  sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
6  great screen and great sound .
menu	 :5.0 Stars
menu with a count 6
1  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
2  i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
3  this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
4  with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
5  navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
t-mobile	 :3.75 Stars
t-mobile with a count 6
1  t-mobile was a pretty good server .
2  service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
3  t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
4  the service from t-mobile is very good too .
5  to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
6  i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
reception	 :2.7272727 Stars

1  we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
2  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .

5  [t]great speakerphone and great reception ! ! recommend !

color	 :5.0 Stars
color with a count 6
1  the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
2  it has a nice color screen .
3  the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
4  the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
5  the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
application	 :4.285714 Stars

1  it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
2  we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
3  technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
4  the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
stuff	 :2.2727273 Stars
stuff with a count 5
1  i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
2  so , i recommend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
3  i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .

1  [t]excellent phone , excellent service .
2  i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
3  service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
4  after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
5  i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
ringtone	 :5.0 Stars
ringtone with a count 5
1  you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
2  the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
3  there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
4  the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
camera	 :5.0 Stars
camera with a count 4
1  if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
2  however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .

4  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
option	 :4.0 Stars
option with a count 4
1  nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
2  so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
3  i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .
4  i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
plan	 :2.5 Stars
plan with a count 3
1  the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
2  we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
3  [t]great plan .
music	 :2.5 Stars
music with a count 2
1  it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
2  the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesn't weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
internet	 :2.5 Stars
internet with a count 2
1  all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
2  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
call	 :2.5 Stars
call with a count 2
1  however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
2  first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
OverAll Rating is : 3.7219656 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .

2  pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?

3  [t]best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) .

4  it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .

5  below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :

6  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .

7  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .

8  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .

9  i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .

10  the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .

11  not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .

12  here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .

13  the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .

14  this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .

15  the volume level of the phone is not all that good .

16  like some other reviewers , i received this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .

17  the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .

18  the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .

19  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .

20  the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --

21  it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .

22  one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .

23  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .

24  this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .

25  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .

26  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .

27  it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .

28  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .

29  [t]people with bad audio quality have defective phones .

30  if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .

31  i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .

32  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .

33  other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .

34  what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .

35  unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .

36  speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .

37  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .

1  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .

2  we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .

3  other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .

1  their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .

2  the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .

3  its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .

4  also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .

5  great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !

6  this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .

1  i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .

2  so , i recommend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )

3  the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .

4  they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .

5  i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .

1  i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .

2  i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .

3  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .

4  this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .

5  tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .

1  i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .

2  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .

3  when talking the voice is not very clear .

4  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .

1  tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .

2  after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .

1  [t]great phone , great service , no voice dialing .

2  after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !

3  i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .

1  the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .

2  negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .

1  the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .

2  first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .

1  also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .

2  the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .

1  i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .

2  i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .

1  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .

2  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .

1  the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .

2  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .

1  the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .

1  it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .

1  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .

1  the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
