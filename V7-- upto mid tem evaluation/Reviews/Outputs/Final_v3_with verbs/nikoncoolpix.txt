1  this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
2  [t]absolutely great point and shoot camera
3  the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
4  i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
5  the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
6  a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
7  in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
8  over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
9  right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
10  awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
11  after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
12  i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
13  i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
14  the software you get with this camera is perfect .
15  the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
16  recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
17  overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
18  this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
19  [t]great camera
20  this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
21  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
22  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
23  [t]best 4-mp camera of its size and price range
24  [t]excellent camera
25  great camera , great investment !
26  i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
27  [t]great camera
28  the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
29  this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
30  still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
31  4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
32  this is a wonderful camera .
33  [t]super little camera
34  really happy with this little camera .
35  i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
36  [t]great camera
37  great camera .
38  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
39  but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
40  if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
41  there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
42  one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
43  this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
44  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
45  [t]amazing camera
46  here were my requirements in a digital camera :
47  great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
48  nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
49  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
50  this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
51  [t]great camera
52  great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
53  [t]great camera for a great price
54  if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
55  [t]perfect consumer digital camera
56  all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
57  [t]excellent compact digital camera
58  ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
59  but this camera is great !
60  [t]super camera
61  it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
62  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
63  [t]excellent little camera
64  it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
picture	 :3.7 Stars
picture with a count 37
1  first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
2  pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
3  the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
4  pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
5  just point and shoot and the photos were great .
6  the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
7  one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
8  i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
9  the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
10  recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
11  however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
12  otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
13  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
14  after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
15  1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
16  the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
17  sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
18  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
19  1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
20  the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
21  it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
22  it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
23  the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
24  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
25  else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 .
26  settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
27  it takes great pictures .
28  it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
battery	 :5.0 Stars
battery with a count 19
1  the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
2  buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
3  an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
4  so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
5  the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
6  comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
7  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
8  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
9  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
10  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
11  an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
quality	 :4.0625 Stars
quality with a count 13
1  the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
2  first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
3  operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
4  i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
5  i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
6  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
7  the quality is superb .
8  the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
nikon	 :5.0 Stars
nikon with a count 7
1  with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
2  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
3  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
4  the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
5  6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
shot	 :5.0 Stars
shot with a count 6
1  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
2  it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
3  the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
4  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
mode	 :3.0 Stars
mode with a count 6
1  the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
2  the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
3  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
4  with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
5  the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
manual	 :4.285714 Stars
manual with a count 6
1  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
2  the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
3  100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
4  the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
image	 :3.75 Stars
image with a count 6
1  uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
2  this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
3  in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
4  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
5  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .

1  it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
2  in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
3  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
4  making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
card	 :2.5 Stars
card with a count 3
1  try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
2  furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
3  else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 .
lens	 :3.3333335 Stars
lens with a count 2
1  the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
2  its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
flash	 :2.5 Stars

1  did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
2  comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .

1  1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
2  the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
speed	 :2.5 Stars
speed with a count 1
1  you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
OverAll Rating is : 3.7268116 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .

2  if you can't get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .

3  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .

4  my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .

5  in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .

6  i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !

7  one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .

8  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .

9  3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .

10  however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .

1  focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .

2  made the camera totally inoperable .

3  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .

4  one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .

5  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :

6  2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .

1  the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .

2  it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .

3  with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .

1  operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .

2  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .

3  i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .

1  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .

1  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .

2  however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .

1  on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .

2  2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .

1  . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image

2  . images taken indoor were n't so clear .

1  2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .

1  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .

1  2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .

1  the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
