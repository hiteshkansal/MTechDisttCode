camera	 :2.9850745 Stars
camera with a count 120
1  this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
2  the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
3  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
4  i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
5  in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
6  i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
7  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
8  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
9  i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
10  overall it is the best camera on the market .
11  [t]canon g3 ? incredible camera
12  this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
13  the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
14  in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
15  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
16  [t]awesome pro-sumer camera
17  even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
18  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
19  the nikon 's are great cameras .
20  her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
21  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
22  simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
23  it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
24  if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
25  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
26  olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
27  [t]great camera
28  all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
29  because this camera is beautiful .
30  [t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels
31  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
32  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
33  i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
34  as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
35  i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
36  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
37  the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
38  for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
39  i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
40  rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
41  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
42  i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
43  [t]this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam
44  am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
45  [t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less
46  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
47  definetely a great camera .
48  [t]best camera i 've used
49  2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
50  [t]fantastic digital camera
51  the camera has a wonderful set of features .
52  i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
53  and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
54  the powershot g3 is a great camera .
55  i am quite happy with the camera .
56  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
57  the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
58  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
59  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
60  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
61  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
62  those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
63  i can't use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
64  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
65  i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
66  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
67  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
68  [t]great camera
69  it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
70  the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
71  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
72  everything else about the camera is great .
73  i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
74  [t]excellent camera
75  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
76  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
77  however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
78  this is a great camera for you !
79  the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
80  i would recommend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
81  [t]great digital camera
82  after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
83  if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
84  this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
85  it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
86  i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
87  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
88  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
picture	 :4.3 Stars
picture with a count 43
1  [t]excellent picture quality / color
2  the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
3  takes excellent photos .
4  i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visible loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
5  first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
6  the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
7  this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
8  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
9  the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
10  the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
11  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
12  7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
13  the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
14  newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
15  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
16  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
17  it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
18  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
19  it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
20  because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
21  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
22  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
23  + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
24  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
25  took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
26  dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
27  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
28  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
29  having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
30  in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
31  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
32  1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
33  the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
34  when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
35  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
36  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
37  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
quality	 :3.6585367 Stars
quality with a count 30
1  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
2  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
3  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
4  it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
5  i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
6  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
7  canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
8  i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
9  it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
10  after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
11  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
12  4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
13  but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
14  the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
15  the image quality is excellent .
16  advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
17  1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
18  [t]pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship
19  i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
20  it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
21  very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
22  1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
23  for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
24  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
25  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
26  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
27  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
canon	 :3.8888888 Stars
canon with a count 14
1  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
2  canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
3  i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
4  a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
5  canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
6  i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
7  i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
8  ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
9  great job canon !
10  this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
11  despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
12  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
mode	 :3.846154 Stars
mode with a count 10
1  the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
2  you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
3  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
4  night mode is clear as day .
5  hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
6  6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
7  the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
8  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
setting	 :4.090909 Stars
setting with a count 9
1  for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
2  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
3  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
4  you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
5  there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
6  i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visible loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
zoom	 :4.4444447 Stars
zoom with a count 8
1  the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
2  the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
3  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
4  3 ) 4x zoom is nice
5  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
6  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
lens	 :2.0 Stars
lens with a count 8
1  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
2  they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
3  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
4  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
5  * lens visible in optical viewfinder .
6  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
7  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
8  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
flash	 :2.6666667 Stars
flash with a count 8
1  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
2  i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
3  the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
4  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
5  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
6  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
7  the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :

1  the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
2  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
3  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
4  overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
5  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
6  a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .

lcd with a count 7
1  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
2  the moveable lcd screen is great .
3  ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
4  - i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very useful .
5  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
6  it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
color	 :5.0 Stars
color with a count 7
1  a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
2  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
3  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
4  great colors , pictures and white balance .
5  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
shutter	 :2.9166665 Stars
shutter with a count 7
1  once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
2  at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
3  i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
4  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
5  the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
range	 :3.3333335 Stars
range with a count 6
1  [t]very good choice in it 's price range
2  what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
3  i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
4  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
5  the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
6  excellent range of metering options as well .

1  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
2  any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
3  messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
4  in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
5  4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .

2  another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
3  the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .

2  and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
3  as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
4  i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !

1  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .

2  [t]the last digital camera i 'll buy

3  i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .

4  this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .

5  this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !

6  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .

7  i just bought the camera a few days ago .

8  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !

9  1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .

10  but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .

11  when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .

12  this is my first digital camera .

13  even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .

14  maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .

15  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .

16  [t]ok for a digital camera

17  simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .

18  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .

19  it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .

20  this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .

21  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .

22  all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .

23  [t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels

24  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .

25  the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .

26  i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .

27  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .

28  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .

29  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

30  as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .

31  for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .

32  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .

33  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .

34  [t]fantastic digital camera

35  the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .

36  the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .

37  the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .

38  the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .

39  and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .

40  a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .

41  the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .

42  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .

43  ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )

44  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .

45  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !

46  prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .

47  battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .

48  this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .

49  however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .

50  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .

51  i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .

52  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .

53  [t]great digital camera

54  if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .

55  a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .

56  i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .

57  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .

58  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .

1  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !

2  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .

3  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .

4  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .

5  there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .

6  but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .

7  what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .

8  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !

9  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .

1  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )

2  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .

3  i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .

4  b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidentally finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .

5  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )

6  in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .

7  ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .

8  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .

9  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .

2  i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .

3  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .

4  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .

5  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .

6  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .

7  as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .

8  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .

9  what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .

10  after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .

1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .

2  i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .

3  unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem can't easily be solved .

4  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .

5  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .

6  i can't use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .

7  it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .

1  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .

2  always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !

3  there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .

4  got way too many blurry pictures .

5  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .

6  well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .

1  - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .

2  - i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very useful .

3  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .

4  after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .

5  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .

1  it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .

2  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

3  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .

4  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .

5  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .

6  as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .

2  1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )

3  i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .

4  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .

1  once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .

2  i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .

3  i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .

4  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .

1  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .

2  still i am a little surprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .

3  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .

4  needless to say , the canon won , hands down .

1  as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .

2  it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .

3  i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .

1  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !

2  the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .

3  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .

1  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .

2  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .

3  flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .

1  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .

2  they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !

3  i would recommend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !

1  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !

2  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )

1  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .

2  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .

1  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .

1  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
