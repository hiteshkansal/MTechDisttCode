1  think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
2  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
3  run[+3], dvd media[+2]#apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
4  most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
5  i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
6  i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .
7  [t] fantastic dvd player for the price .
8  it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
9  [t] my first dvd player and i 'm well satisfied !
10  for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
11  i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
12  forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
13  i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine .
14  for the most part this is a good dvd player .
15  seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
16  only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
17  [t] excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.
18  when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
19  this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
20  i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
21  i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
22  i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
23  these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
24  this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
25  seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
26  i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .
27  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
28  what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
29  this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
30  for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
31  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .
32  i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
33  i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
34  for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
35  i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .

1  i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
2  [t] my first dvd player and i 'm well satisfied !
3  it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
4  the dvd player is fine .
5  as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
6  this player seems to work fine with everything else .
7  i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
8  also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
9  as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
10  unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
11  im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
12  [t] great budget player .
13  had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
14  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
15  but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
16  well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
17  the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
18  when the player was working it was great ,but .
19  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
20  the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
21  i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
22  [t] avoid apex dvd players - even if they 're free !
23  [t] great dvd player .
24  [t] great player ... when it worked !
25  this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
26  progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
27  for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
28  player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
29  for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
30  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .
31  [t] best player for the buck .
32  i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
33  i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .

1  the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
2  my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
3  by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
4  the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !
5  for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
6  the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
7  received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
8  the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
9  i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
10  excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
11  maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
12  there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
13  the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays a lot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
14  it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )

1  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
2  most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
3  i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
4  the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .
5  i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
6  the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
7  i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
8  any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
9  i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
10  i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
11  anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
12  my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
13  without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
14  i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .

1  i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
2  of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
3  and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
4  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
5  [t] great by for the price .
6  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
7  i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
8  my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
9  [t] great value .
10  i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
11  i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
12  if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
13  [t] for the price , an excellent buy .
14  [t] good price , bad product .

quality with a count 14
1  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
2  the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
3  i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
4  it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
5  do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
6  i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
7  good quality video .
8  apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
9  i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
10  great quality picture and features .
11  what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
12  for the money , get a better quality player .
13  i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !

1  amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
2  ( good going , amazon ).
3  i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
4  i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
5  thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
6  finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
7  i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
8  hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
movie	 :3.846154 Stars

1  the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
2  i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
3  another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
4  connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
5  unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
6  i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
7  output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
8  well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .

1  nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
2  i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
3  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
4  i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
5  for the money apex machines have good features .
6  besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
7  it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .

1  there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
2  the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .

OverAll Rating is : 2.982894 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
2  the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
3  so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
4  what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
5  after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
6  unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
7  for the most part this is a good dvd player .
8  i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
9  on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
10  the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
11  [t] excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.
12  it is embarrassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
13  bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
14  this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
15  i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
16  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
17  it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
18  ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
19  so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
20  this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
21  i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
22  [t] has destroyed several of my dvds and cds .
23  1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "
24  ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
25  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
26  3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
1  the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
2  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
3  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
4  little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
5  i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
6  [t] frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player !
7  and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
8  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .
9  when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
10  one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
11  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
12  at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
1  [t] awkward remote ; flimsy build quality .
2  the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
3  there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
4  [t] poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's .
5  very bad quality .
6  apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
7  customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
8  [t] poor quality dvd player .
9  [t] poor quality .
1  my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
2  the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !
3  it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
4  maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
5  it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
1  tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
2  finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
3  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
4  5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
5  i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
6  my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
7  do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
8  if you are skeptical about trying apex .
1  the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
2  [t] the ad2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
3  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
4  having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
5  the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
6  picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .
1  it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
2  less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
3  seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
4  the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
5  on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
6  when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
7  when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
1  of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
2  and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
3  i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
4  this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
5  either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
6  this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
7  [t] good price , bad product .
