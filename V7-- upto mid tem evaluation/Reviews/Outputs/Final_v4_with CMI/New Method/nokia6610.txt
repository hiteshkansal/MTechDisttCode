phone with a count 149
1  [t]excellent phone , excellent service .
2  there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
3  below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
4  my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
5  i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
6  [t]slightly better than average phone in its class .
7  my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
8  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
9  the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
10  their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
11  [t]good phone , so-so service .
12  the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
13  here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
14  [t]cool phone !
15  like some other reviewers , i received this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
16  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
17  the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
18  nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
19  [t]t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone .
20  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
21  overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
22  the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
23  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
24  they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
25  this is the best phone i have seen .
26  [t]perfect phone .
27  if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
28  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you won't scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidentally hitting the keys .
29  the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
30  [t]great phone , great service , no voice dialing .
31  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
32  other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
33  unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
34  [t]best phone for free .
35  please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
36  two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
37  this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
38  this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beautiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
39  [t]great phone , but what did you say ?
40  i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
41  from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
42  for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
43  the phones are awesome .
44  overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
45  the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesn't weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
46  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
47  i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
48  nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
49  [t]a good phone .
50  this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
51  ***[t]great phone , but no warranty !
52  the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
53  this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
54  it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
55  this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
56  [t]great speakerphone and great reception ! ! recommend !
57  the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
58  while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
59  nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
60  this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
61  although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
62  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
63  the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
64  [t]awesome phone choice .
65  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
66  the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
67  this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
68  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
69  one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
70  it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
71  the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
72  this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
73  great phone , i 'd buy another .
74  [t]excellent phone .
75  excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
76  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
77  great phone .. .
78  the battery life on this phone is surreal .
79  nice little phone ... light compact . .
80  i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
81  it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
82  that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
83  overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
84  speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
85  [t]awesome phone , great prices on amazon.com .
86  it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
87  [t]best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) .
88  i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
89  i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
90  the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
91  1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
92  although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
93  this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
94  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
95  great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
96  which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
97  overall an excellent phone .
98  one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
99  do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
100  i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
101  this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
102  this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
103  [t]6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand .
104  and really this is the best phone one could have .
105  [t]best of the best mobile phone .
106  tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
107  while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
108  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .

2  i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
3  the radio feature has superb sound quality .
4  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
5  the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
6  the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
7  nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
8  the most important thing for me is sound quality .
9  the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
10  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .

4  it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
5  the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
6  sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .

8  - outstanding signal reception
9  whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .

5  - very long-lasting battery life
6  the battery life is amazing .
7  great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .

game with a count 10
1  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
2  it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
3  i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
4  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
5  there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
6  disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
7  nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com

1  the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
2  i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
3  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
4  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
5  sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .

1  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
2  ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
3  i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
4  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
5  [t]nokia 6610 great for games and ringtones .
6  the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .

t-mobile with a count 7
1  t-mobile was a pretty good server .
2  with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
3  service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
4  t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
5  the service from t-mobile is very good too .
6  to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
7  i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .

3  this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .

5  navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .

1  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .

option	 :4.285714 Stars
option with a count 6
1  nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
2  using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
3  - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
4  so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
5  i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .
6  i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .

4  after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !

OverAll Rating is : 3.637476 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
2  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
3  my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
4  my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
5  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
6  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
7  i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
8  not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
9  the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
10  here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
11  the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
12  the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
13  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
14  one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
15  no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
16  it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
17  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
18  this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
19  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
20  the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
21  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
22  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
23  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
24  they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
25  it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
26  i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
27  nice little phone ... light compact . .
28  i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
29  what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
30  when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
31  the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
32  speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
33  [t]best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) .
34  i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didn't really need one .
35  the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
36  the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
37  this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
38  the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
39  the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
40  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
41  the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesn't weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
42  it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
43  one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
44  the phone is very light weight .
45  i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
46  this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
47  it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
48  [t]people with bad audio quality have defective phones .
49  that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
50  [t]6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand .
51  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
1  their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
2  the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
3  its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
4  also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
5  great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
6  this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
1  i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
2  so , i recommend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
3  the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
4  they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
5  i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
1  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
2  we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
3  other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
1  i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
2  i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
3  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
4  this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
5  tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
1  i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
2  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
3  when talking the voice is not very clear .
4  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
1  [t]great phone , great service , no voice dialing .
2  after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
3  i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
4  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
1  the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
2  negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
3  [t]people with bad audio quality have defective phones .
1  tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
2  after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
1  i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
2  apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
3  i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
1  also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
2  the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
1  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
2  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
1  the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
2  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
1  with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
1  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
1  the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
1  the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
