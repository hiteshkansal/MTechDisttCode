player	 :3.4732823 Stars
player with a count 91
1  i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
2  7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
3  like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
4  i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
5  i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
6  you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
7  after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
8  before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
9  now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
10  [t] good player , but this technology is not yet great .
11  i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
12  one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
13  now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
14  they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
15  artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
16  bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
17  [t] terrific mp3 player , great price .
18  because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
19  can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
20  first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
21  [t] good player , bad software .
22  creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
23  much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
24  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
25  all the buttons & necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
26  this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
27  a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
28  i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player .
29  alright , well i read a lot of these reviews , and i read a lot of bad and good things about this player .
30  i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
31  [t] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .
32  i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
33  at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
34  to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
35  10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
36  this player is an ideal purchase .
37  in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
38  the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
39  the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
40  not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
41  i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
42  as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
43  this thing seriously is a good player though .
44  i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
45  i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
46  i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
47  all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
48  i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
49  i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "
50  the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
51  the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
52  it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
53  [t] great player .
54  it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
55  i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
56  this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
57  otherwise , this player is awesome !
58  this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
59  overall , this player is awesome and i definitely recommend it .
60  and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
61  [t] a great player for the price .
62  [t] the best jukebox mp3 player , hands-down .
63  the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
64  also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
65  i guess that 's why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing .
66  if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
67  the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
68  if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
69  first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder structure .
70  anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
71  on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
72  i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
73  [t] great player .
74  although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
ipod	 :3.3064518 Stars
ipod with a count 82
1  zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
2  the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
3  while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
4  like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
5  ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
6  yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
7  it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
8  yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
9  granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
10  1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
11  many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
12  no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
13  way less expensive than the ipod .
14  before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
15  an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
16  the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
17  the price compared to the ipod is great .
18  the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
19  despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
20  sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
21  sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
22  also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
23  i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
24  in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
25  the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
26  please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
27  other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
28  none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
29  again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
30  i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
31  the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
32  what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
33  im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
34  the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
35  to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
36  i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
37  do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
38  overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
39  1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
40  i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
41  [t] the best ipod alternative .
42  for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
43  despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
44  this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
45  sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
46  most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
47  the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
48  the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
49  nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
50  unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
51  size - bigger than the ipod
52  while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
53  - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
54  apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
55  a similarly priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
56  the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
57  try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
58  itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
59  i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
60  i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
quality	 :3.0737705 Stars
quality with a count 75
1  the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
2  this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
3  5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
4  the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
5  1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
6  now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
7  while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
8  on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
9  the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
10  if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
11  finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
12  the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
13  i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
14  it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
15  the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
16  i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
17  the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
18  i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , which is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
19  - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
20  i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
21  sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
22  the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
23  up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
24  you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
25  the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
26  the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
27  ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
28  the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
29  sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
30  first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
31  bummer as it has great sound quality .
32  it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
33  for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
34  the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
35  it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
36  + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
37  the other controls are all very easy to use .
38  our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
39  [t] great memory , quality ?
40  they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
41  all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
42  lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
43  [t] unmatched quality and beyond cool .
44  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
45  my only significant complaint is sound quality .
46  most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
47  also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
48  sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
49  karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
50  being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
51  usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
52  the sound quality is very good .
53  [t] easy to use , massive storage space , sounds great .
54  the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
55  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
56  the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
57  the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
58  btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
59  if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
software	 :3.272727 Stars
software with a count 72
1  the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
2  i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
3  the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
4  the software is great .
5  transferring is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
6  i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
7  the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
8  creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
9  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
10  [t] good for the money , but software is awful .
11  software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
12  although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
13  -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
14  this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
15  yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
16  if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
17  playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
18  the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
19  as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
20  however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
21  the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
22  win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
23  d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesn't work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
24  many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
25  creative software stinks .
26  the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
27  compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
28  the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
29  all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
30  great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
31  great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
32  itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
33  - the software that came with it was tough to load .
34  redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
35  third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
36  i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
37  so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
38  a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
39  for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
40  the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
41  - included creative software is pretty poor .
42  the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
43  when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
44  the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
45  the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) .
46  i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
47  also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
48  the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
49  1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
50  i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
51  try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
52  the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
battery	 :3.939394 Stars
battery with a count 52
1  other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
2  the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
3  plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
4  6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
5  zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
6  5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
7  the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
8  the battery is nice .
9  lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
10  it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
11  [t] replaceable battery lets zennx keep running and running .
12  my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
13  zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
14  since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
15  great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
16  great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
17  even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
18  6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
19  still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
20  * removable battery
21  our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
22  short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
23  battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
24  it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
25  creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
26  1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
27  price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
28  pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
29  the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
30  everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
31  the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
32  the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
33  the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
34  - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
35  also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
song	 :3.0666666 Stars
song with a count 46
1  the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
2  not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
3  the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
4  you can also search for your song , which is good .
5  4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
6  this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
7  this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
8  over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
9  now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
10  once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
11  the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
12  but for someone who cares about their music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
13  that 's important because i have a lot of music .
14  the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what a lot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
15  you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
16  and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
17  second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
18  if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
19  finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
20  this is a good deal for music and data storage .
21  [t] excellent way to carry your music collection !
22  for me the sound of the music is what is important .
23  - uploading music is quick and easy .
24  m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
25  it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
26  -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
27  having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
28  the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
29  this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
30  having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
31  it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
32  you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
33  if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
34  some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
35  it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
36  this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
37  excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
38  i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
39  the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
40  i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
computer	 :3.75 Stars
computer with a count 30
1  navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
2  creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
3  1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
4  after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
5  i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
6  accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
7  i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
8  what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
9  if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
10  when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
11  the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
12  it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .
13  it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
14  [t] fantastic piece of machinery .
15  that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
16  creative labs customer support website is useless .
17  i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , because it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
18  [t] great product for a windows computer .
19  when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
20  1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
21  the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
22  one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
23  enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
24  11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
mp3	 :4.117647 Stars
mp3 with a count 28
1  i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
2  considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
3  before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
4  i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
5  the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
6  all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
7  all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
8  if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
9  if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
10  but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
11  i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
12  if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
13  [t] great mp3 player .
14  for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
15  it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
16  this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
17  [t] terrific mp3 player , great price .
18  so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
19  well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
20  all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
21  btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labelled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
22  compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
23  i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
24  the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
25  in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
file	 :4.0 Stars
file with a count 24
1  navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
2  navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
3  i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
4  then sorting the files is easy as pie .
5  getting files onto it is quick and painless .
6  once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
7  these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
8  after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
9  this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
10  i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
11  it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
12  sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
13  the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
14  to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
15  transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
16  i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
17  accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
zen	 :3.75 Stars
zen with a count 24
1  the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
2  the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
3  i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
4  the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
5  creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
6  given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
7  so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
8  i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
9  m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
10  naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
11  if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
12  the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
13  i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
14  [t] important zen information .
15  the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
16  to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
17  the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
18  the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
19  feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
20  granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
21  i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
nomad	 :3.8 Stars
nomad with a count 19
1  is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
2  i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
3  this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
4  otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
5  the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
6  [t] nomads are wonderful , but be carefull !
7  i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
8  i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
9  [t] creative nomad zen xtra 40 gb .
10  the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
11  those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
12  my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
13  3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
14  i love my new nomad , its great !
15  transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
16  i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
17  i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
explorer	 :3.6000001 Stars
explorer with a count 18
1  3 ) user replaceable battery
2  [t] the bundled software blows , yes ... ... but i heard of notmad explorer ( http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people .
3  took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
4  2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
5  red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
6  after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
7  it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
8  i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
9  not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
10  i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
11  oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet
12  if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
13  our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
14  first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
15  the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .
16  now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource .
scroll	 :2.2058823 Stars
scroll with a count 15
1  the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
2  easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
3  as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
4  the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
5  the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
6  the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
7  creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
8  one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
9  scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
10  the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
11  the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
12  now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .

headphone with a count 15
1  for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
2  come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
3  also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
4  i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
5  get better headphones .
6  the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
7  enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
8  the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
9  for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
10  the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
11  on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
12  headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
13  the free ( i didn't know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
xtra	 :4.0 Stars
xtra with a count 12
1  bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
2  the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
3  navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
4  i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
5  to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
6  10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
7  the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
8  try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
9  i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
10  after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
jukebox	 :3.6666667 Stars
jukebox with a count 11
1  i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
2  [t] the best jukebox mp3 player , hands-down .
3  i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
4  i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
5  this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
6  i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
7  red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
8  actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
9  finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
playlist	 :3.125 Stars
playlist with a count 10
1  if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
2  pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
3  meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
4  the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
5  it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
6  you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
7  it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
8  i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
9  i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
genre	 :3.125 Stars
genre with a count 10
1  you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
2  the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
3  the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
4  this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
5  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
6  it would have been better to have some sort of window on the carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
7  some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
8  looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
track	 :4.0 Stars
track with a count 8
1  the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
2  the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
3  while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
4  my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !
5  and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
6  you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
drive	 :0.34883723 Stars
drive with a count 3
1  this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
2  b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
3  my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
OverAll Rating is : 3.325297 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
2  first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
3  the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
4  the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
5  sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
6  first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
7  in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
8  this did not give me enough control .
9  bummer as it has great sound quality .
10  i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "
11  the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
12  + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
13  it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
14  if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
15  our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
16  finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
17  construction quality is a difficult item .
18  - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
19  i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
20  all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
21  i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
22  the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
23  lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
24  creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
25  [t] depressingly poor quality .
26  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
27  my only significant complaint is sound quality .
28  i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , which is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
29  sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
30  - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
31  karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
32  [t] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .
33  the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
34  the sound quality is very good .
35  sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
36  controls are a bit awkward .
37  sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
38  the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
39  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
40  i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
41  the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
42  the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
43  sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
1  everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
2  the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
3  while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
4  choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
5  loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
6  its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
7  it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
8  im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
9  my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
10  the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
11  1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
12  apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
13  overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
14  ( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recommend it instead ) .
15  now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
16  the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 " ) .
17  the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
18  this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
19  i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
20  hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
21  most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
22  [t] poor substitute for an ipod .
23  it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
24  simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
25  ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .
26  however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about " white noise " in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
27  ipod clearly has the most buzz .
28  most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
29  apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
30  a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
31  that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
32  since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
1  cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
2  i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
3  the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
4  after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
5  before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
6  [t] good player , but this technology is not yet great .
7  i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
8  because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
9  can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
10  i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
11  finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
12  the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
13  honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
14  based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
15  hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
16  as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
17  7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
18  also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
19  m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
20  i guess that 's why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing .
21  if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
22  alright , well i read a lot of these reviews , and i read a lot of bad and good things about this player .
23  the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
24  first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder structure .
25  as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
26  well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
27  2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
28  possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
29  the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
30  when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
31  if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
32  i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
1  the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
2  the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
3  after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
4  it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
5  in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
6  flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
7  the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
8  however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
9  basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
10  i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
11  it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
12  get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
13  i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
14  4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
15  mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
16  the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 " ) .
17  the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
18  if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
19  my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
20  after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
21  3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
22  always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
23  ( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
24  so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
25  if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
26  a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
27  buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
28  some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
29  however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
30  b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
31  i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
1  the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
2  the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
3  however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
4  win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
5  d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesn't work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
6  many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
7  the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
8  i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
9  i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
10  the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
11  not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
12  third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
13  [t] good player , bad software .
14  [t] the interfacing software is unacceptably bad .
15  third party software to the rescue
16  [t] good for the money , but software is awful .
17  i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
18  so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
19  quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
20  dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
21  creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
22  a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
23  although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
24  -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
25  - included creative software is pretty poor .
26  * software is absolutely terrible :
27  this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
28  1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
29  the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
30  in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
31  the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
1  it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
2  the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
3  its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
4  if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
5  my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
6  yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
7  also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
8  minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
9  you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
10  finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
11  well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
12  2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "
13  several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
14  the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
15  m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
16  -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
17  this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
18  the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
19  i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
20  this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
21  you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
22  it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
23  2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
24  this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
25  ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transferring , and more )
26  it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
27  btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
1  the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
2  as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
3  2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
4  the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
5  the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
6  depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
7  * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
8  the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
9  the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
10  the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
11  the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
12  transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
13  [t] hard disk mp3 players .
14  people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
15  the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
1  everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
2  i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
3  zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
4  5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
5  battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
6  it also has unproven battery life .
7  removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
8  all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
9  the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
10  since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
11  everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
12  short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
13  if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
1  as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
2  crappy headphones .
3  the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
4  * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
5  the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
6  also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
7  you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
8  for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
9  with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
10  the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
1  creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
2  creative labs customer support website is useless .
3  itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
4  accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
5  in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
6  for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
7  the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
8  if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
9  the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
10  on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
1  the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
2  is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
3  however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
4  the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
5  feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
6  but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
7  i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
1  that is , if a folder on your computer called " mp3 " has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
2  [t] not durable enough for this road warrior .
3  took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
4  besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
5  the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
6  the general button placement is not very user friendly .
1  having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
2  3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
3  sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
4  the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
5  2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
6  every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
1  on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
2  i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
3  this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
4  the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
5  now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
6  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
1  the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
2  kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
3  -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
4  some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
1  i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
2  playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
3  the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
4  the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
5  ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
6  while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
1  so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
2  i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
3  battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
4  so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
5  it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
1  software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
2  i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
3  10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
1  the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
2  the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
3  after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
1  2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
2  10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
