dvd with a count 39
1  after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
2  most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
3  it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
4  i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
5  so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
6  what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
7  i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
8  forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
9  i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine .
10  seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
11  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
12  [t] excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.
13  when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
14  the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
15  this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
16  i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
17  i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
18  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
19  i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
20  the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays a lot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
21  player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
22  [t] poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's .
23  seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
24  player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
25  for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
26  i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .

1  most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
2  [t] the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last .
3  i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
4  i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
5  the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .
6  i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
7  the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
8  we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
9  [t] apex and remote control .
10  you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
11  i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
12  i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we won't be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
13  any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
14  apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
15  i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
16  i will never buy another apex digital product !
17  i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
18  anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
19  i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
20  same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
21  have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .

player with a count 34
1  my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
2  when the player was working it was great ,but .
3  i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
4  the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
5  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
6  before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
7  called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
8  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
9  little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
10  [t] frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player !
11  as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
12  [t] great dvd player .
13  [t] great player ... when it worked !
14  this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
15  at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
16  also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
17  progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
18  for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
19  what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
20  im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
21  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .
22  when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
23  [t] best player for the buck .
24  i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
month	 :4.25 Stars
month with a count 34
1  repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .
2  purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
3  i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
4  mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
5  each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
6  i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
7  after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
8  i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
9  i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
10  anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
11  only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
12  i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
13  i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
14  update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
15  less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
16  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
17  save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
18  this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
19  the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
20  set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
21  in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
22  i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
23  what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
24  apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
25  i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
26  i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .

problem with a count 31
1  i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
2  the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
3  purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
4  i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
5  i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
6  most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
7  it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
8  had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
9  i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
10  i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
11  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
12  for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
13  unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
14  any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
15  on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
16  i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
17  i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
18  besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
19  the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
20  they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
21  the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
22  i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .

1  i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
2  of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
3  and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
4  [t] fantastic dvd player for the price .
5  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
6  [t] great by for the price .
7  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
8  i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
9  my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
10  [t] great value .
11  i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
12  if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
13  [t] for the price , an excellent buy .
14  progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
15  [t] good price , bad product .
16  for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
picture	 :3.6956522 Stars
picture with a count 17
1  the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
2  by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
3  for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
4  the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
5  also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
6  received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
7  the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
8  maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
9  there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
10  [t] no picture and / or no sound , try i/p button on the remote .
unit	 :3.409091 Stars
unit with a count 15
1  there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
2  still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
3  i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
4  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
5  the entire unit was poorly crafted .
6  another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
7  unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
8  it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
9  it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
10  but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .

3  amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
4  i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
5  thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
6  finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
7  i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
8  i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
9  hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .

1  the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
2  the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
3  i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
4  connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
5  i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
6  output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
7  i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .

OverAll Rating is : 3.6564891 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .

2  i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .

3  after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .

4  seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .

5  i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .

6  so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .

7  i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .

8  - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .

9  [t] excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.

10  [t] has destroyed several of my dvds and cds .

11  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !

12  i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .

13  after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .

1  also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .

2  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .

3  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .

4  one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .

5  i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .

6  i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .

7  at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .

1  tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .

2  finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .

3  apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .

4  i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .

5  if you are skeptical about trying apex .

1  the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .

2  the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !

3  it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )

1  of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .

2  and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?

3  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .

4  this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .

5  either way , can 't go wrong with this price .

6  this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .

7  bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .

1  [t] poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's .

2  unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .

3  these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .

4  the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .

5  have had problems since the first day

6  when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .

1  but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .

2  it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .

3  maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .

4  picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .

1  save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .

2  i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !

3  it is embarrassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .

4  for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .

5  we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .

1  i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .

2  [t] good price , bad product .

3  that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .

4  customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .

1  amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !

2  save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .

3  do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !

4  i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .

1  i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .

2  comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased separately ) and also component video outputs .

1  prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !

2  first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

3  [t] a frustrating christmas .

1  for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .

1  it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .

2  the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .

1  first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
