camera with a count 248
1  the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
2  ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
3  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
4  in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
5  this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
6  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
7  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
8  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
9  after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
10  [t]canon g3 ? incredible camera
11  in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
12  when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
13  i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
14  [t]awesome pro-sumer camera
15  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
16  not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
17  the nikon 's are great cameras .
18  her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
19  if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
20  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
21  olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
22  the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
23  [t]great camera
24  flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
25  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
26  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
27  i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
28  i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
29  i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
30  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
31  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
32  [t]this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam
33  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
34  [t]best camera i 've used
35  2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
36  [t]fantastic digital camera
37  the camera has a wonderful set of features .
38  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
39  the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
40  the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
41  the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
42  and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
43  the powershot g3 is a great camera .
44  a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
45  i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
46  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
47  the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
48  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
49  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
50  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
51  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
52  prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
53  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
54  4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
55  i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
56  [t]great camera
57  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
58  the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
59  this camera has a major design flaw .
60  after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
61  i received the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
62  but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
63  everything else about the camera is great .
64  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
65  this is a great camera for you !
66  a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
67  this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
68  it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
69  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
70  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
71  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
72  this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
73  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
74  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
75  [t]the last digital camera i 'll buy
76  [t]outstanding camera
77  i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
78  this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
79  i just bought the camera a few days ago .
80  i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
81  i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
82  overall it is the best camera on the market .
83  but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
84  this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
85  the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
86  this is my first digital camera .
87  even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
88  [t]ok for a digital camera
89  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
90  simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
91  it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
92  this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
93  all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
94  because this camera is beautiful .
95  [t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels
96  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
97  the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
98  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
99  as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
100  for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
101  rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
102  i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
103  am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
104  [t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less
105  definetely a great camera .
106  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
107  i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
108  for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
109  this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
110  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
111  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
112  i am quite happy with the camera .
113  ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
114  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
115  in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
116  battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
117  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
118  it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
119  however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
120  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
121  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
122  i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
123  [t]excellent camera
124  however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
125  the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
126  [t]great digital camera
127  after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
128  unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
129  i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
130  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
131  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
picture	 :4.7580643 Stars
picture with a count 118
1  the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
2  takes excellent photos .
3  i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visible loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
4  there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
5  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
6  the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
7  as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
8  [t]the pictures are brillient
9  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
10  the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
11  it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
12  with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
13  - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
14  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
15  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
16  + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
17  great colors , pictures and white balance .
18  took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
19  1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
20  when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
21  4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
22  the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
23  got way too many blurry pictures .
24  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
25  it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
26  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
27  i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
28  the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
29  the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
30  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
31  i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
32  newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
33  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
34  make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
35  to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
36  it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
37  it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
38  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
39  because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
40  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
41  what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
42  i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
43  when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
44  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
45  dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
46  having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
47  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
48  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
49  the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
50  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
g3	 :4.53125 Stars
g3 with a count 58
1  i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
2  the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
3  at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
4  i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
5  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
6  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
7  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
8  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
9  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
10  being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
11  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
12  ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
13  i can't use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
14  those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
15  unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
16  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
17  yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
18  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
19  what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
20  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
21  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
22  after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
23  the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
24  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
25  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
26  overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
27  unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
28  i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
29  the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
30  the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
31  the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
quality	 :4.7959185 Stars
quality with a count 47
1  i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
2  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
3  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
4  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
5  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
6  i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
7  i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
8  4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
9  [t]pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship
10  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
11  ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
12  for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
13  1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
14  from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
15  yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
16  i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
17  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
18  but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
19  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
20  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
21  what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
22  after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
23  the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
24  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
25  there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
26  very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
27  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
28  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .

1  for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
2  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
3  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
4  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
5  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
6  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
7  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
8  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
9  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
10  i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
11  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
12  the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
13  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
14  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
15  messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
16  a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
17  but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
2  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
3  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
4  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
5  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
6  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
7  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
8  at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
9  i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
10  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
11  at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
12  a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
13  i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
14  i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
15  b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidentally finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
16  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
17  but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
18  i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
19  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
20  not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
21  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isn't , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
22  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
23  next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
2  in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
3  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
4  the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
5  as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
6  i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
7  first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
8  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
9  [t]you 'll take more pics
10  i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
11  7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
12  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
flash	 :4.7999997 Stars

1  the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
2  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
3  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
4  i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
5  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
6  the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
7  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
8  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
9  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
10  ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
11  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
12  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
13  flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .

1  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
2  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
3  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
4  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
5  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
6  the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
7  + you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
8  however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
9  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
10  in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
11  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
12  the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
13  * lens visible in optical viewfinder .
14  ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
15  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
range	 :4.75 Stars
range with a count 19
1  range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
2  what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
3  you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
4  i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
5  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
6  i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
7  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
8  the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
9  but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
10  excellent range of metering options as well .

1  it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
2  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
3  you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
4  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
5  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
6  based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
7  the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
8  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
9  ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
10  as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
canon	 :3.6956522 Stars
canon with a count 17
1  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
2  canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
3  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
4  1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
5  canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
6  canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
7  still i am a little surprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
8  ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
9  this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
10  i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
11  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
12  they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
13  i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
14  i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
15  proven canon built quality and lens .

g2 with a count 15
1  looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
2  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
3  a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
4  some of the great gains over g2 --
5  6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
6  i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
7  being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
8  [t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less
9  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
10  2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
11  it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
moment	 :5.0 Stars
moment with a count 3
1  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
2  the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
OverAll Rating is : 4.503394 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .

2  this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .

3  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .

4  it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .

5  the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .

6  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .

7  i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .

8  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .

9  i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .

10  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .

11  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

12  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .

13  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )

14  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !

15  i would recommend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !

16  1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .

2  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .

3  b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidentally finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .

4  although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .

5  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .

1  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .

2  1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )

3  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .

4  needless to say , the canon won , hands down .

1  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .

2  always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !

3  - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .

4  got way too many blurry pictures .

5  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .

6  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .

1  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )

2  i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .

3  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )

4  in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .

5  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .

1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .

2  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .

3  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .

4  being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .

5  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .

1  it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .

2  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

3  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .

4  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .

5  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .

1  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .

2  i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .

1  for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .

2  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .

1  it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .

1  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .

1  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .

1  i can't use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
