1  the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .

2  ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .

3  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .

5  this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !

6  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .

7  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
8  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !

9  [t]canon g3 ? incredible camera
	at final_dissertation.Starter.main(Starter.java:160)
10  when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
11  [t]awesome pro-sumer camera
12  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
13  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
14  the nikon 's are great cameras .
15  her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
16  olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
17  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
18  [t]great camera
19  the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
20  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
21  i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
22  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
23  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
24  i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
25  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
26  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
27  [t]best camera i 've used
28  2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
29  [t]fantastic digital camera
30  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
31  the powershot g3 is a great camera .
32  and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
33  a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
34  the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
35  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
36  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
37  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
38  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
39  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
40  prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
41  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
42  i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
43  [t]great camera
44  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
45  the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
46  they look fantastic .
47  everything else about the camera is great .
48  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
49  this is a great camera for you !
50  a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
51  it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
52  this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
53  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
54  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
55  [t]the last digital camera i 'll buy
56  [t]outstanding camera
57  this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
58  i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
59  overall it is the best camera on the market .
60  this is my first digital camera .
61  i am very pleased with it so far .
62  even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
63  [t]ok for a digital camera
64  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
65  simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
66  [t]the best so far
67  because this camera is beautiful .
68  all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
69  [t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels
70  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
71  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
72  as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
73  the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
74  [t]boxy ? no -- gorgeous
75  for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
76  rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
77  i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
78  am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
79  [t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less
80  definetely a great camera .
81  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
82  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
83  i am quite happy with the camera .
84  ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
85  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
86  battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
87  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
88  it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
89  the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
90  instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
91  however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
92  i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
93  [t]excellent camera
94  the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
95  i 'm very glad i did .
96  [t]great digital camera
97  if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
98  i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
99  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .

1  [t]excellent picture quality / color
2  takes excellent photos .
3  i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
4  the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
5  the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
6  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
7  the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
8  as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
9  the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
10  newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
11  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
12  it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
13  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
14  it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
15  because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
16  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
17  with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
18  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
19  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
20  + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
21  i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
22  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
23  took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
24  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
25  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
26  having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
27  overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
28  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
29  1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
30  the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
31  when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
32  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
flash	 :4.7916665 Stars
flash with a count 23
1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
2  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
3  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
4  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
5  the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
6  ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
7  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
8  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
9  flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
10  it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
11  i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
12  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
13  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isn't , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
14  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
15  the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
image	 :4.7619047 Stars
image with a count 20
1  the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
2  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
3  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
4  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
5  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
6  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
7  overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
8  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
9  but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
10  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
11  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
12  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
13  after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
zoom	 :4.7222223 Stars
zoom with a count 17
1  the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
2  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
3  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
4  i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
5  the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
6  3 ) 4x zoom is nice
7  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
8  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
9  the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
g3	 :4.642857 Stars
g3 with a count 13
1  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
2  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
3  yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
4  unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
5  there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
6  what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
7  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
8  this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
9  i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
10  the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
11  what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
12  those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
lens	 :3.5294118 Stars
lens with a count 12
1  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
2  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
3  they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
4  ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
5  * lens visible in optical viewfinder .
6  ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
7  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
8  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
9  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
10  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
mode	 :4.5833335 Stars
mode with a count 11
1  the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
2  the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
3  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
4  night mode is clear as day .
5  hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
6  i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
7  the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
8  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
9  got way too many blurry pictures .
10  in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
time	 :4.1666665 Stars
time with a count 10
1  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
2  i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
3  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
4  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
5  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
6  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
7  not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
8  next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
9  at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
10  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
film	 :3.8888888 Stars
film with a count 7
1  but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
2  i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
3  first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
4  [t]you 'll take more pics
5  i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
6  i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
canon	 :3.5 Stars
canon with a count 7
1  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
2  i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
3  i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
4  ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
5  still i am a little surprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
6  proven canon built quality and lens .
setting	 :4.375 Stars

1  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
2  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
3  you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
4  with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
5  i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visible loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .

point with a count 6
1  for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
2  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
3  rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
4  good points :
5  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
result	 :5.0 Stars
result with a count 5
1  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
2  any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
3  messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
4  in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
5  6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
lcd	 :5.0 Stars
lcd with a count 5
1  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
2  ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
3  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
4  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .

1  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
2  the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
unit	 :3.75 Stars
unit with a count 3
1  i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
2  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
3  the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
g2	 :5.0 Stars
g2 with a count 3
1  looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
2  i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
3  it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
slr	 :5.0 Stars
slr with a count 2
1  [t]if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital
2  what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
shutter	 :3.3333335 Stars
shutter with a count 2
1  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
2  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
shot	 :2.0 Stars
shot with a count 2
1  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
2  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
cf	 :5.0 Stars
cf with a count 2
1  i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
2  i received the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
megapixel	 :3.3333335 Stars
megapixel with a count 2
1  overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
2  four megapixels is great .
olympus	 :5.0 Stars
olympus with a count 1
1  i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
OverAll Rating is : 4.3066306 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .

2  maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .

3  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .

4  [t]boxy ? no -- gorgeous

5  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !

6  i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .

1  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )

2  i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .

3  in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .

4  ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .

5  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .

1  always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !

2  got way too many blurry pictures .

3  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .

4  well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .

1  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .

2  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .

3  needless to say , the canon won , hands down .

1  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

2  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .

3  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .

1  as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .

2  it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .

1  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .

2  negative points :

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .

2  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !

1  4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .

1  the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .

1  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .

1  unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem can't easily be solved .

1  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .

1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .

1  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .

1  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .

1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
