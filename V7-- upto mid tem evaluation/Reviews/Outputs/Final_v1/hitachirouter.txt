router	 :3.75 Stars
router with a count 12
1  This is an excellent router for the price.
2  The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
3  This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
4  If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
5  Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
6  I must have gotten a good one.
7  Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
8  It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
9  I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.
10  This is an excellent router for the money.
11  So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
12  If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
start	 :5.0 Stars
start with a count 11
1  The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
2  The soft start is nice.
3  This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
4  Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
5  I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
6  Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
7  Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
8  Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
hand	 :5.0 Stars
hand with a count 6
1  The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
2  I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
3  The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
4  Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
5  It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
6  Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
tool	 :4.285714 Stars
tool with a count 6
1  This is a well-made and powerful tool.
2  This is a fantastic tool to use.
3  It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
4  For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
price	 :5.0 Stars
price with a count 4
1  Overall it is a great value.
2  The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
3  Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
4  The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
bit	 :2.5 Stars
bit with a count 3
1  I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
2  Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
3  It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
machine	 :3.75 Stars
machine with a count 3
1  It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
2  But, for the money it is a good machine.
3  When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
table	 :5.0 Stars

1  So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
2  Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.

OverAll Rating is : 4.253247 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.

2  I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.

3  It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.

4  However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).

1  The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.

2  The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.

3  Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping

1  I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.

1  Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.

1  It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
