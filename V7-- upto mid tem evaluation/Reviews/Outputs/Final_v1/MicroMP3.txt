1  Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
2  When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.
3  ) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
4  I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.
5  The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
6  I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
7  The accesories that come with the player are great.
8  I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.
9  This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.
10  t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
11  Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go.
12  I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features.
13  PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
14  I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
15  This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
16  In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
17  I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
18  Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
19  The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.
20  The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
21  They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
22  The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it.
23  I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
24  The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
25  Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
26  With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
27  Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.
28  The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
29  Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.
30  It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
battery	 :4.5833335 Stars
battery with a count 22
1  I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
2  Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
3  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.
4  Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."
5  I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.
6  The battery is removable.
7  I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
8  Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
9  A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
10  - Replaceable battery.
11  :) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
12  It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
13  You can buy a new battery for 49.99.
14  The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
15  Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
16  My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
17  It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
18  I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!
zen	 :4.7222223 Stars
zen with a count 17
1  White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
2  I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
3  I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
4  so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
5  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
6  The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
7  Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
8  Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
9  That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
10  Amazing.
11  If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   ##Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
12  00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
13  Zen micro does.
sound	 :4.7058825 Stars
sound with a count 16
1  It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
2  Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
3  The sound is very nice.
4  You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
5  An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
6  What impressed me most was the sound.
7  Gets nice sound too.
8  FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.
9  The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass.
10  To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
11  The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
12  The sound is amazing.
13  The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
14  the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.
15  The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
16  Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
software	 :4.0625 Stars
software with a count 13
1  With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
2  The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.
3  Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
4  Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
5  The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
6  The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.
7  I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
8  I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
9  To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC.
10  You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player.
11  The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
ipod	 :4.6153846 Stars
ipod with a count 12
1  They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom).
2  The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod.
3  It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
4  Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
5  This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
6  All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
7  I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
8  In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
9  Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.
10  The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
11  The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
hour	 :5.0 Stars
hour with a count 12
1  The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.
2  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
3  where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
4  The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
5  I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
6  For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight.
7  Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
8  The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.
headphone	 :3.6666667 Stars
headphone with a count 11
1  The earbud headphones are really nice.
2  and supply those stupid white Headphones.
3  The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
4  sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
5  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
6  - Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
7  I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users. ##I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago.
8  The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
9  The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.

1  Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
2  Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
3  The menu is easy to use and understand.
4  They're easy to use.
5  Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
6  The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
7  -User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
8  My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
9  Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
song	 :4.5 Stars
song with a count 9
1  Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
2  I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
3  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
4  But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
5  At 128 the songs sound very good.
6  It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
7  You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
8  If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   ##Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
9  They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
radio	 :3.8888888 Stars
radio with a count 7
1  - Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
2  ) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
3  The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
4  The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
5  Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
6  Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.

1  I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
OverAll Rating is : 4.265923 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.

2  I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.

3  This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.

4  The player was large and bulky.

5  I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.

6  Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!

7  It's too bad, though, that !

8  Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.

9  players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.

10  The player was not very appealing either.

1  and supply those stupid white Headphones.

2  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".

3  I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users. ##I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago.

4  the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.

1  Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.

2  This proprietary software to download.

3  Still has terrible software.

1  Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.

2  It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.

1  Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works.

2  Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only because of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!

1  by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.

1  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.

1  It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer.

1  I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features.

1  This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.

1  Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).
