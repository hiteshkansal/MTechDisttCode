1  this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
2  the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
3  i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
4  in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
5  over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
6  right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
7  awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
8  i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
9  the software you get with this camera is perfect .
10  [t]small camera
11  the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
12  most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
13  recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
14  overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
15  this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
16  [t]great camera
17  2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
18  this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
19  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
20  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
21  [t]best 4-mp camera of its size and price range
22  [t]excellent camera
23  great camera , great investment !
24  i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
25  [t]great camera
26  this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
27  still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
28  this is a wonderful camera .
29  [t]super little camera
30  really happy with this little camera .
31  i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
32  [t]great camera
33  great camera .
34  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
35  yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
36  but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
37  [t]it 's so cool
38  there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
39  this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
40  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
41  this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
42  [t]amazing camera
43  here were my requirements in a digital camera :
44  great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
45  nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
46  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
47  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
48  this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
49  [t]great camera
50  2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
51  great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
52  [t]great camera for a great price
53  it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
54  a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
55  if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
56  all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
57  [t]excellent compact digital camera
58  ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
59  but this camera is great !
60  [t]super camera
61  i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
62  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
63  [t]excellent little camera
64  in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
65  it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
picture	 :4.347826 Stars
picture with a count 20
1  1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
2  the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
3  the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
4  just point and shoot and the photos were great .
5  3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
6  however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
7  i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
8  the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
9  the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
10  recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
11  however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
12  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
13  otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
14  even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
15  after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
16  the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
17  it takes great pictures .
18  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
battery	 :5.0 Stars
battery with a count 19
1  so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
2  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
3  the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
4  comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
5  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
6  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
7  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
8  3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
9  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
10  an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
11  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
12  buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
13  an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
14  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
15  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
pic	 :4.0625 Stars
pic with a count 13
1  it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
2  the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
3  very large pics take 8mb each !
4  the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
5  it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
6  making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
7  5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
8  settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
9  it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
10  sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
zoom	 :4.5833335 Stars
zoom with a count 11
1  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
2  for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
3  it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
4  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
5  9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
6  in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
7  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
8  making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
9  the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
setting	 :4.5833335 Stars
setting with a count 11
1  the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
2  1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
3  however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
4  even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
5  3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of surroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
6  the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
7  got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .

1  . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
2  this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
3  in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
4  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
5  . images taken indoor were n't so clear .
6  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
7  [t]you will not be sorry
mode	 :4.375 Stars
mode with a count 7
1  it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
2  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
3  with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
4  in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
5  i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
6  over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
7  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
shot	 :5.0 Stars
shot with a count 6
1  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
2  on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
3  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
4  the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
5  one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
card	 :2.5 Stars
card with a count 3
1  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
2  i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
3  we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
flash	 :3.3333335 Stars

1  did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .

1  the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
2  5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
nikon	 :5.0 Stars
nikon with a count 2
1  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
2  6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
manual	 :5.0 Stars
manual with a count 1
1  the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
OverAll Rating is : 4.421174 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .

2  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .

3  i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .

4  made the camera totally inoperable .

5  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .

6  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .

1  i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !

2  3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .

1  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .

1  if you can't get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .

2  [t]it do n't get better

3  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .

1  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .

1  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .

1  on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .

1  . images taken indoor were n't so clear .

1  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
