1  this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
2  the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
3  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
4  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
5  [t]the last digital camera i 'll buy
6  [t]outstanding camera
7  ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
8  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
9  this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
10  in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
11  this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
12  just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
13  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
14  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
15  i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
16  overall it is the best camera on the market .
17  [t]canon g3 ? incredible camera
18  when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
19  this is my first digital camera .
20  [t]awesome pro-sumer camera
21  even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
22  i am very pleased with it so far .
23  [t]ok for a digital camera
24  the nikon 's are great cameras .
25  her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
26  simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
27  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
28  olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
29  [t]the best so far
30  the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
31  [t]great camera
32  all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
33  because this camera is beautiful .
34  [t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels
35  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
36  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
37  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
38  i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
39  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
40  as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
41  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
42  for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
43  rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
44  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
45  i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
46  am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
47  [t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less
48  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
49  definetely a great camera .
50  [t]best camera i 've used
51  2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
52  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
53  [t]fantastic digital camera
54  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
55  and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
56  the powershot g3 is a great camera .
57  i am quite happy with the camera .
58  a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
59  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
60  the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
61  ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
62  recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
63  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
64  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
65  the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
66  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
67  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
68  battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
69  i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
70  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
71  [t]great camera
72  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
73  it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
74  the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
75  however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
76  they look fantastic .
77  everything else about the camera is great .
78  i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
79  [t]excellent camera
80  this is a great camera for you !
81  the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
82  i 'm very glad i did .
83  [t]great digital camera
84  a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
85  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
86  it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
87  i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .

1  takes excellent photos .
2  i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
3  the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
4  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
5  the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
6  the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
7  as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
8  [t]the pictures are brillient
9  newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
10  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
11  it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
12  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
13  it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
14  because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
15  with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
16  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
17  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
18  + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
19  i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
20  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
21  took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
22  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
23  having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
24  overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
25  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
26  1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
27  when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
quality	 :4.375 Stars
quality with a count 21
1  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
2  yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
3  i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
4  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
5  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
6  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
7  what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
8  i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
9  4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
10  the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
11  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
12  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
13  for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
14  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
flash	 :5.0 Stars

1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
2  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
3  i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
4  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
5  the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
6  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
7  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
8  ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
9  bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
10  fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
11  flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .

1  the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
2  now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
3  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
4  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
5  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
6  i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
7  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
8  but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
9  and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
10  without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
11  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
g3	 :4.5 Stars
g3 with a count 9
1  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
2  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
3  yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
4  unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
5  what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
6  contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
7  i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
8  those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
time	 :3.3333335 Stars
time with a count 8
1  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
2  i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
3  b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidentally finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
4  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
5  not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
6  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
7  next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
8  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
lens	 :3.6363637 Stars
lens with a count 8
1  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
2  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
3  * lens visible in optical viewfinder .
4  ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
5  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
6  the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
7  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .

1  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
2  i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
3  ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
4  still i am a little surprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
5  proven canon built quality and lens .
range	 :5.0 Stars
range with a count 6
1  what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
2  i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
3  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
4  the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
5  but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .

1  looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .

Negative summery is: 
1  this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .

2  maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .

3  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .

4  [t]boxy ? no -- gorgeous

5  i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !

6  i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .

1  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .

2  i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .

3  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .

4  at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .

1  always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !

2  got way too many blurry pictures .

3  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .

1  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .

2  although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .

3  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .

1  2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )

2  in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .

3  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .

1  i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .

2  it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .

1  these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

2  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .

1  the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .

2  needless to say , the canon won , hands down .

1  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
