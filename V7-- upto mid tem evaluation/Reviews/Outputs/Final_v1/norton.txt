1  This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
2  These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
3  If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
4  I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
5  If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
6  If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
7  The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
8  I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.

problem with a count 5
1  I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
2  The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
3  The biggest problem is the installation.
4  For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
5  I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).

1  At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
2  All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
3  I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.

5  Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.

1  So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
2  I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
nis	 :5.0 Stars
nis with a count 1
1  I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.

1  For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.

firewall with a count 1
1  While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
OverAll Rating is : 2.9626622 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).

2  This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.

3  I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.

4  Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.

1  I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.

2  An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.

3  Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.

4  But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.

5  I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).

1  I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.

2  I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.

1  I decided to give it one last chance... so I formatted my hard drive, reinstalled Windows XP (which also required a day & night download/install of SP2 on dial-up) and put NIS2004 back onto the computer.

2  Next I de-fragged my hard drive.

1  Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.

2  I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!

1  It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.

1  And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
