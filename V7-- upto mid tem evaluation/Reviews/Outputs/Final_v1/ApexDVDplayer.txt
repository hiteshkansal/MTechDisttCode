1  ##before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
2  ##little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
3  player[+2][p]##it works great .
4  player[+2]##the dvd player is fine .
5  work[+3], player[+2][u]##works great !
6  player[-2]##one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
7  player[+2]##also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
8  i/p button[+2]##im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
9  player[+2],sound[-1]##i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
10  player[-3][p]##the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
11  player[+2][u]##simple to use and hook up .
12  player[-2]##when the player was working it was great ,but .
13  media[+2][u]##it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
14  player[+2]##i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
15  ##called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
16  player[-3][p]##who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
17  player[+3][p]##i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
18  player[+3][p]##but for what i do use it is perfect .
19  [t] great player ... when it worked !
20  player[-3]##the first one would n't work from the start .
21  video output[-3]##this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
22  player[+3]##this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
23  ##for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
24  set up[+1],player[-2]##set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
25  player[+1]##well , it was nice while it lasted .
26  player[+2]##this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
27  player[-3]##3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
28  player[+2][p]##i liked this one enough to buy another .
29  player[-2]##i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
30  design[+2],player[+2]##as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
31  player[+2]##unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
32  player[+1]##for the most part this is a good dvd player .
33  player[-1]##nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
34  player[-2][p]##unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .
35  ##my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
36  player[+1][p]##it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
37  player[+1]##i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
38  look[+2],feature[+2]##the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
39  player[+2][p]##i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
40  player[+2][u]##i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
41  ##i simply watched the extra features on another player .
42  player[+2][p]##so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
43  [t] great dvd player .
44  progressive scan player[+2],price[+2]##progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
45  ##what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
46  player[-2]##all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .
47  player[+2][p]##this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
48  [t] best player for the buck .
49  player[-3]##i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
50  disc[-1], recognize[-2]##i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
51  player[+1]##i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .

dvd with a count 43
1  dvd[+1]##and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
2  dvd[-2], play[-2]##after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
3  run[+3], dvd media[+2]#apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
4  ##most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
5  run[+2], dvd[+2]##it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
6  feature[+1]##i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
7  ##so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
8  read[-2], dvd[-2]##at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
9  ##so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
10  dvd[-2]##what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
11  ##i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
12  play[-2], dvd[-2]##forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
13  [t] does not play dvds with extra features .. .
14  ##i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
15  [t] excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.
16  player[-3]##the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
17  player[-2][p]##this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
18  auto fit[+2]##i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
19  media[+2][u]##it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
20  dvd[-3]##i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
21  play[-2], dvd[-2]##- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
22  dual-layer dvd[-2]##player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
23  [t] poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's .
24  dvd[+2],sound[+2]##seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
25  ##so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
26  player[+1], look[+3]##player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
27  [t] has destroyed several of my dvds and cds .
28  ##there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
29  format[+2]##i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .

apex with a count 37
1  apex[+2]##most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
2  [t] the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last .
3  ##i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
4  dvd player[+3]##i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
5  ##the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .
6  apex[-1]##i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
7  apex[+2]##the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
8  remote[-2]##we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
9  [t] apex and remote control .
10  ##i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
11  [t] apex ad-2600 compatability .
12  ##i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
13  ##any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
14  apex[+3]##apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
15  on-line support[-3][u]##i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
16  ##i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
17  ##i will never buy another apex digital product !
18  customer service[-3][u]##i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
19  ##anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
20  play[-2], dvd[-2], no disc[-2]##i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
21  service[-3]##same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .

3  no disc[-2], screen[-3][u]##less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "

5  media[+2][u]##it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
6  ##save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
7  support[-3]##i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
8  player[-2]##the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
9  customer support[-3]##after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
10  ##in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
11  ##i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
12  ##what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
13  player[-3]##i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
14  ##i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
15  customer service[-2]##apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
16  player[-2]##only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
17  ##anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
18  ##i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
19  case[+2]##for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .

21  player[+2],sound[-1]##i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
22  color signal[-2]##this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
23  ##i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
24  disc[-1], recognize[-2]##i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .

1  freezing[-1]##the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
2  ##but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
3  ##i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
4  ##most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
5  dvd[-2]##it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
6  ##had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
7  player[+3][u]##i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
8  ##i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
9  ##if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
10  ##for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
11  player[+2]##unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
12  dvd[-2]##on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
13  ##i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
14  ##i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
15  player[-2][u]##have had problems since the first day
16  player[+2]##besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
17  ##the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .

19  player[-3]##the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
20  ##i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
output	 :4.7916665 Stars
output with a count 23
1  read[-2], disc[-2]##the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
2  ##i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
3  audio output[+2]##another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
4  player[-3][u]##unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
5  video output[-3]##video output stopped workin .
6  video output[-3]##this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
7  ##the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
8  output[-2]##output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
9  ##connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
10  output[+3]##output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
11  video output[-3[p][u]##so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !

14  video output[-3]##well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .

1  read[-2], disc[-2]##the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
2  dvd[-3],cd[-3], no disc[-2]##seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
3  no disc[-2]##on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
4  play[+2][p]##i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
5  disc[-1], recognize[-2]##i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .

OverAll Rating is : 3.7022333 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  ##i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .

2  ##called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .

3  player[+2]##i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .

4  [t] frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player !

5  ##as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .

6  remote control[-2]##one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .

7  [t] great dvd player .

8  remote[-1]##in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .

9  player[-3]##i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .

10  player[+1]##i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .

11  player[-3][u]##what the hell is wrong with this thing .

12  read[-2], dvd[-2]##at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .

13  player[+2]##also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .

14  player[-3]##i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !

15  player[+1][p]##it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .

16  player[-2]##all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarrassing gift .

17  format[+2][u]##when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .

1  ##i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .

2  ##save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .

3  ##i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !

4  player[-3][p]##mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .

5  dvd player[-3]##it is embarrassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .

6  ##one stopped working in february and the other in march .

7  player[-2]##i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .

8  player[-2][p]##each of the 4 lasted less than six months .

9  ##we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .

10  ##this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .

1  freezing[-1]##the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "

2  [t] poor quality - problem with dual-layer dvd 's .

3  player[+2]##unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .

4  ##any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .

5  player[+1][p]##i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .

6  ##these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .

7  ##the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .

8  format[+2][u]##when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .

1  tech support[-3]##tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .

2  code[-2]##finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .

3  ##any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .

4  apex[+3]##apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .

5  customer service[-3]##i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .

6  ##if you are skeptical about trying apex .

7  ##you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .

1  ##i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .

2  ##i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine .

3  player[-3][p]##after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .

4  dvd[-2]##first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

5  dvd[+2],sound[+2]##seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .

6  feature[+1]##i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .

7  ##there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !

8  play[+2], different file[+2]##the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays a lot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .

1  ##i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we won't be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .

2  unit[+3], format[+2]##the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !

1  player[+3][p]##of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .

2  price[+3]##and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?

3  player[+2]##i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .

4  player[-3]##this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .

5  price[+2]##either way , can 't go wrong with this price .

6  player[+3]##this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .

7  ##bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .

1  remote[-2]##i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .

2  [t] good price , bad product .

3  ##that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .

4  customer service[-3], technical support[-3]##customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .

1  picture[-2]##it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .

2  ##maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .

3  ##picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .

1  play[-2], disney movie[-2]##many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .

2  button[-2]##i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .

3  play[+2], different file[+2]##the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays a lot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .

1  ##amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !

2  ##do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .

3  ##do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !

4  player[+2]##i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .

1  door[-1]##the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .

2  play[+2], mpeg[+2]##it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .

1  ##prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !

2  dvd[-2]##first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

3  [t] a frustrating christmas .

1  loading[-2][u]##it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .

2  build quality[+2],picture[+2],sound[+2]##the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .

1  dvd[-2]##first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

2  ##i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .

1  ##i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
