1  Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
2  This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.
3  It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
4  Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.
5  ) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
6  They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
7  The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
8  Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go.
9  I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features.
10  I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
11  The accesories that come with the player are great.
12  I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.
13  t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
14  PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
15  Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
16  Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.
17  I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
18  I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
19  This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
20  In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
21  The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
22  The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
23  When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.
24  The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
25  The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.
26  I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
27  With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
28  I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.
29  The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it.
30  Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
battery	 :4.7916665 Stars
battery with a count 23
1  It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
2  It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
3  Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
4  I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.
5  The battery is removable.
6  I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!
7  I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
8  The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
9  Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
10  My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
11  - Replaceable battery.
12  A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
13  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.
14  :) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
15  I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
16  Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
17  You can buy a new battery for 49.99.
18  Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."
19  Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
product	 :4.090909 Stars
product with a count 18
1  It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
2  It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
3  As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
4  While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.
5  This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
6  It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
7  Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
8  The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.
9  :) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
10  ) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup.
11  It COULD have been a great product.
12  i didn't get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.
13  I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
zen	 :4.6875 Stars
zen with a count 15
1  Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
2  I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
3  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
4  Zen micro does.
5  I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
6  00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
7  White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
8  Amazing.
9  The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
10  Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
11  so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
12  That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
ipod	 :4.5833335 Stars
ipod with a count 11
1  The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
2  I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
3  In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
4  Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.
5  They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom).
6  It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
7  All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
8  This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
9  The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod.
10  Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
software	 :3.846154 Stars
software with a count 10
1  Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
2  With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
3  The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
4  The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.
5  Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
6  The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.
7  I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
8  The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
headphone	 :3.846154 Stars
headphone with a count 10
1  and supply those stupid white Headphones.
2  The earbud headphones are really nice.
3  The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
4  - Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
5  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
6  sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
7  The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
8  The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
song	 :4.375 Stars
song with a count 7
1  They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
2  You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
3  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
4  At 128 the songs sound very good.
5  But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
6  Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
7  It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
micro	 :5.0 Stars
micro with a count 2
1  For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight.
2  I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
napster	 :2.5 Stars
napster with a count 1
1  I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
OverAll Rating is : 4.138738 Out of 5 Stars
Negative summery is: 
1  players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.

2  Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.

3  This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.

4  It's too bad, though, that !

5  The player was large and bulky.

6  PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.

7  Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!

8  I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.

9  I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.

10  The player was not very appealing either.

1  The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.

2  It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.

3  Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.

4  It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.

1  Still has terrible software.

2  Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.

3  This proprietary software to download.

1  and supply those stupid white Headphones.

2  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".

3  the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.

1  It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.

1  It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer.

1  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.

1  This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.

1  Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).
